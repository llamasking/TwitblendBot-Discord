# Terms

By using this bot, you allow us to:

 1. See command usage and associated information. This includes which command you used and which argument(s) you gave it.
 2. See when the bot is added to or removed from a server and how many users are in the server.
 3. See when these things happen. Timestamps are attached to all logged information.

Anything logged is strictly used to further bot development. **Any and all obtained information will not sold or shown to anyone for any reason.** The bot also does **not** log or respond to any messages not started with `!!`, such as regular chat messages.

I, llamasking, am the only person who can or will ever see the logs and I only ever look at them is when I'm adding new features and debugging.

These terms describe the exact data logged. Of the bots I checked, none described the data logged by the bot.
