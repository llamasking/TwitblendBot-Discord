# Twitblend Bot -- Discord

## Invite
You can not currently invite this bot. It's not ready to be released. I am waiting on several things. 
1. Learning how to sanatize user input, as the bot uses child_process.exec. (Please send help if you know how to not use it.)
2. Wildcard0 may push some updates to Twitblend, making it easier to work with.

## About
This bot amalgamates the recent (30 days) Tweets of any two twitter accounts through the use of [Twitblend](https://github.com/wildcard0/Twitblend).
