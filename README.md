# Twitblend Bot -- Discord

## Invite
You can not currently invite this bot. It's not ready to be released, as it's very much incomplete and probably insecure, as it uses child_process.exec().

You can however join the bot's testing server if you want to try it out in it's incomplete state. [https://discord.gg/4V8YtPG]

## About
This bot amalgamates the ~~recent (30 days)~~ Tweets of any two twitter accounts through the use of [Twitblend](https://github.com/wildcard0/Twitblend).
