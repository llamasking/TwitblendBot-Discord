# Twitblend Bot - Discord

## Invite
You can not currently invite this bot. It's not ready to be released, as it's very much incomplete and probably insecure. ~~as it uses child_process.exec().~~ Well it no longer uses exec, instead using execFile but it's still insecure since Twitblend REQUIRES a shell to be able to work in the first place. 

## About
This bot amalgamates the Tweets of any two twitter accounts through the use of [Twitblend](https://github.com/wildcard0/Twitblend). Note that Twitblend does NOT weigh inputs.
